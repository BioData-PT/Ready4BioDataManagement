## Ready for BioData Management? - Advanced Data Management Plans

### Do you want to apply for a H2020 project and are struggling with the Data Management Plan (DMP)?

**Ready for BioData Management? - Advanced Data Management Plans** is a one-day course where participants will be guided through the process of preparing a real DMP for a real research project, according to the H2020 DMP template.

The course assumes participants have basic notions of DMPs. It will feature a lecture introducing the DMPOnline platform that the participants will be using, and another lecture overviewing the H2020 DMP template, but the majority of the course will be a hands-on session where participants prepare a DMP in the platform, in pairs.

Participants are encouraged to bring their own research project or project plan, in the interest of producing a DMP that is relevant for them.
