# Hands-On DMP Creation Exercise

## Format

Participants will be organized into groups and asked to create their version of a DMP for the ![mock project](https://github.com/BioData-PT/Ready4BioDataManagement/blob/master/Materials/Mock_Project.md), by following the exercise guide below, and using the ![canvas](https://github.com/BioData-PT/Ready4BioDataManagement/blob/master/Materials/Canvas_DMP.pdf) as physical support.

The created DMP should comply with the DMP Common Standard documentation.

Participants will be guided through the creation of their DMPs by the monitors. Each participant group will be given 5 “help tokens”. Groups will be allowed to exchange their “help tokens” for a 2 minute help by one of the monitors. Participants groups are allowed to exchange as many “help tokens” per step as they find necessary, as long as they have “help tokens” available. Exchanged “help tokens” will be kept by the monitoring staff.

In order to expedite the DMP Creation process, it will be divided into 5 sequential steps. Participants have a timeslot to complete their current step, when this timeslot runs out, the next step will be introduced. This method will ensure that participants are not overwhelmed by the complexity of the model. This will also ensure that by the end of the event, all participant groups will have completed the creation of a DMP that is compliant with the DMP Common Standard.

After this stage, participants will present their DMPs. The focus of the presentation should fall on decisions that were taken, and any difficulties that were encountered, that were directly imposed by the model.
The DMP and presentation will be assessed and discussed by a panel of judges, who will also select the best DMP.
The classification criteria should be as follows:
- Content relevance
- Level of detail
- Presentation
- Feedback
- “Help Token” usage 


## Exercise Guide
### Step 1 - Administrative Data
The first step focuses on the administrative data of the DMP. To that effect, participants must provide information pertaining to the following classes:
- Contact - A person or institution that is to serve as contact for this DMP.
- DMStaff - A characterization of the staff members that are to be listed within this DMP.

### Step 2 - Project and Funding
This step characterizes the project to which the DMP is associated, as well as its funding. In that regard, participants must provide information pertaining to the following classes:
- Project - Information regarding the project to which the DMP is associated.
- Funding - Specific information pertaining the funding to the project.

### Step 3 - DMP
In this step, participants are asked to characterize the DMP, by providing information pertaining to the following classes:
- DMP - A characterization of the DMP.
- Cost - Information of the associated costs of the DMP.

### Step 4 - Datasets
In this step participants will be focusing on describing all existing datasets. As such, they will have to provide information on the following classes:

- Datasets - A characterization of all the datasets associated with the DMP
- Security and Privacy - A characterization of any security and privacy policies associated with each of the identified datasets.
- Technical Resource - A characterization of any technical resources associated to each of the identified datasets.
- Metadata - A characterization of metadata associated to each of the identified datasets.

### Step 5 - Preservation and Publication
In the final step, participants must detail the preservation and publication policies. To do so, they must provide information pertaining to the following classes:

- Distribution - Information regarding the policies on how each dataset is to be distributed.
- License - A characterization of the licenses associated with each distribution policy.
- Host - A characterization of the preservation policies.
