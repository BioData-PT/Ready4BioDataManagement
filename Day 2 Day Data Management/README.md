This is a one-day, introductory, hands-on course aimed at Life Sciences researchers (with at least PhD frequency level) and lab managers.

It focuses on the day-to-day data management aspects of research activities, like planning, annotation, deposit, aiming to empower researchers and lab managers to improve the efficiency of data management throughout the life cycle of the data and enable reproducibility and reusability.

The course features an introduction to topics such as The FAIR Principles and Open Science best practices, Data Management Plans, metadata standard and ontologies, an overview of online data management resources, and practical components centred on data documentation using Electronic Lab Notebooks and data sharing using DataVerse.
