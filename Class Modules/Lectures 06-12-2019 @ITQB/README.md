# Ready4BioDataManagement – Lecture 1

## Title: Introduction to Data Management in Science

## Teacher: Daniel Faria

## Abstract

Scientific data and publications are increasing at an exponential rate, which makes data and knowledge discovery ever more challenging. Good data management practices are key to alleviating this problem, by ensuring that data is published in a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) way. This has been recognized by funding agencies throughout the world, which now commonly demand open science policies from their fundees, and by publishers, which are starting to require that the data associated with a scientific publication be published in accordance with the FAIR principles.
Introduction to Data Management in Science is a one-hour lecture that introduces the topic of data management, discusses its relevance in modern science and the benefits that derive therefrom, reviews the state of the art with respect to data management best practices, and demonstrates how to put them into practice.

## Title: Demystifying Data Management Plans

## Teacher: João Cardoso

## Abstract

A data management plan (DMP) is a document detailing what data will be collected by a project or institution, and how it will be collected, processed, described, preserved, shared, and potentially reused. In short, it is a document planning the data management activities that will apply to the data collected in a specified context, which is critical to ensure that the necessary resources (human and financial) are allocated to those activities. DMPs are now commonly required by science funding agencies in the US and EU as part of grant applications, which means that researchers from all domains have to become used to preparing such documents.
Demystifying Data Management Plans is a one-hour lecture dissecting the typical structure of a DMP (according to the RDA’s common DMP model), overviewing the key concerns that researchers should have when filling a DMP, and demonstrating how to prepare a DMP for a mock research project (under the common DMP model).
