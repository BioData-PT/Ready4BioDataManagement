# Demystifying Data Management Plans (DMPs)

Currently, researchers are being encouraged by funders and institutions to expose the results produced by their projects. Moreover, the main funding agencies in the US and EU now require to attach Data Management Plans (DMP) to their grant applications. 

In general, a good DMP needs to contain information on how research data will be collected, processed, shared, reused, preserved and described. Additionally, the plan should describe the general context of the project, the people responsible for research data management, and also point out any ethical and legal issues.

The creation of the DMP is a time-consuming task, that requires effort, knowledge of metadata standards, data publication experience, and appropriate tools. All these factors contribute to diminish researchers motivation to create a DMP. That is why many institutions are developing tools to facilitate all Research Data Management (RDM) activities, including DMP creation.

Researchers often face difficulties in research data management activities and in creating DMPs and keeping them updated, especially with regard to the following aspects.

## Data Collection
Researchers have to anticipate and explain the kinds and amounts of data will be created during the project.
It is important to clarify whether the data is public, private, sensitive, personal, etc.
Researchers should state the origin of their data (e.g. Is it RAW data produced during your project or RAW data from other sources).
Researchers must also indicate how the data will be collected (e.g. website, interviews, a specific tool, observations in habitat according to established methodology, etc.).

## Documentation and Metadata
Researchers have to clarify which documentation will be created during the project (e.g. message exchanges, paper documents, such as notes in the meeting or Excel spreadsheet with some calculations and measurements, etc. )
Moreover, researchers need to indicate how data will be described (e.g. are metadata standards such as Dublin Core, Darwin Core, Inspire, etc. being used?)

## Ethics and Legal Compliance
Researchers need to reflect on what kind of data is being produced during the project.
Is it sensitive data that requires a Privacy Impact Assessment?
Is it personal data that requires a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?
Is it public data with the obligation of authorization by the Ethics Committee?
Is it private data belonging to a specific institutions?

## Storage and Backup
Researchers need to define how, where and which data will be storage and which schedule must be applied to backups. The amound of data is a critical factor.
Is it an external disk or an institutional server?
Who will be responsible for the backups?
Which data should be stored---the RAW data or the processed data?
There are any technical questions such as encryption and anonymization for application before the storage?
Who has access to the data and what type of access? 


## Data Sharing
Finally, researchers need to decide on the data repository where their data will be published.
Is it an institutional repository or a domain-specific repository?
If it is the latter, are any restrictions for reusing the data?
Does the data have a free open license, such as Share-Alike?
Or a specific license with limitations? 


# DMP Common Standard Model
This is a minimum set of universal terms that we agree on which ensure basic interoperability of systems using machine actionable DMPS.
Further fields can be added in specific deployments, but they do not guarantee interoperability.
DMP tools can use any other fields in their internal data models.
This standard allows modelling a wide range of use cases and does not set any business (e.g. funder specific) requirements.
It allows modelling information over the whole DMP lifecycle.
