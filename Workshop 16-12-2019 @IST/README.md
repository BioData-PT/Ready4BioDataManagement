Introduction to Data Management Plans is an introductory one-day workshop aiming at disseminating Data Management best practices and teaching the basics of making and using Data Management Plans (DMPs) in the context of research activities.
The course features two introductory lectures on Data Management and DMPs, followed by a hands-on DMP exercise where participants will form groups to fill-in a DMP for a mock research project on our custom canvas. The produced DMPs will then be presented, discussed and evaluated.
